# Ralph Loop

**Input**: the context_session file documented in the github issue

---

## Your Mission

Start an autonomous Ralph loop that executes a plan iteratively until all validations pass.

**Core Philosophy**: Self-referential feedback loop. Each iteration, you see your previous work in files and git history. You implement, validate, fix, repeat - until complete.

**Skill Reference**: The `ralph-loop` skill provides detailed execution guidance. It will be automatically available during loop iterations.

---

## Phase 1: PARSE - Validate Input

### 1.1 Fetch Github issue
- Fetch latest branches: `git fetch origin`
- Fetch issue title: `gh issue view $ARGUMENT$ --json title -q .title`


### 1.1 Parse Arguments

Extract from input:
- **File path**: Must start with `context_session_*`
- **Max iterations**: `--max-iterations N` (default: 10)

### 1.2 Validate Input Type

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Starts with `.context_session_*` | Valid - use as plan file |
| Free-form text | STOP with message below |
| No input | STOP with message below |

**If invalid input:**
```
Ralph requires the github_issue.

Ralph requires a branch called feature-issue-$ARGUMENTS in a worktree

Ralph requires a context_session plan documented in the issue.

Create one first:
  /explore-plan-ch "your feature description"   # Creates plan from description

Then run:
  /ralph-loop .claude/sessions/context_session_{your-feature}.md --max-iterations 10
```

### 1.3 Verify File Exists

```bash
test -f "{file_path}" && echo "EXISTS" || echo "NOT_FOUND"
```

**If NOT_FOUND**: 
1. git worktree add ./.trees/feature-issue-$ARGUMENTS -b feature-issue-$ARGUMENTS
2. cd .trees/feature-issue-$ARGUMENTS
3. Create `.claude/sessions/context_session_{github_issue}.md` where plan is going to be updated with all the future iterations and feedback
4. Plan the changes and update the context_session file

### 1.4 If Context session File - Select Next Phase


1. Read the context_session plan
2. Parse Implementation Phases table
3. Find first phase with `Status: pending` where dependencies are `complete`
4. Report which phase will be executed
5. Note: The loop will create and execute a plan for this phase

**PHASE_1_CHECKPOINT:**
- [ ] Input parsed (file path + max iterations)
- [ ] File exists and is valid type
- [ ] If context_session file: next phase identified

---

## Phase 2: SETUP - Initialize Ralph Loop

### 2.1 Create State File

Create `.claude/ralph.state.md`:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude
mkdir -p .claude/ralph-archives
```

Write state file with this structure:

```markdown
---
iteration: 1
max_iterations: {N}
plan_path: "{file_path}"
started_at: "{ISO timestamp}"
---

# Ralph Loop State

## Codebase Patterns
(Consolidate reusable patterns here - future iterations read this first)

## Current Task
Review the context_session plan and iterate until all validations pass.

## Plan Reference
{file_path}

## Instructions
1. Read the input file
2. Implement all incomplete tasks
3. Run ALL validation commands from the plan
4. If any validation fails: fix and re-validate
5. Update plan file: mark completed tasks, add notes
6. When ALL validations pass: output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>

## Progress Log
(Append learnings after each iteration)

---
```

### 2.2 Display Startup Message

```markdown
## Ralph Loop Activated

**Plan**: {file_path}
**Iteration**: 1
**Max iterations**: {N}

The stop hook is now active. When you try to exit:
- If validations incomplete → same prompt fed back
- If all validations pass → loop exits

To monitor: `cat .claude/ralph.state.md`
To cancel: `/ralph-cancel`

---

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Work through ALL tasks in the plan
- Run ALL validation commands
- Fix failures before proceeding
- Only output <promise>COMPLETE</promise> when ALL validations pass
- Do NOT lie to exit - the loop continues until genuinely complete

---

Starting iteration 1...
```

**PHASE_2_CHECKPOINT:**
- [ ] State file created
- [ ] Archive directory exists
- [ ] Startup message displayed

---

## Phase 3: EXECUTE - Work on Plan

### 3.1 Read Context First

Before implementing anything:
1. Read the state file - check "Codebase Patterns" section
2. Read the context_session file - understand all tasks
3. Check git status - what's already changed?
4. Review progress log - what did previous iterations do?

### 3.2 Identify Work

From the plan, identify:
- Tasks not yet completed
- Validation commands to run
- Acceptance criteria to meet

### 3.3 Implement

For each incomplete task:
1. Read the requirements
2. Read any MIRROR/pattern references
3. Implement the change
4. Run task-specific validation if specified

### 3.4 Validate

Run ALL validation commands from the plan:

```bash
# Typical validation levels (adapt to plan)
poetry run pytest
poetry build
```

### 3.5 Track Results

| Check | Result | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Type check | PASS/FAIL | {details} |
| Tests | PASS/FAIL | {details} |
| Build | PASS/FAIL | {details} |

### 3.6 If Any Validation Fails

1. Analyze the failure
2. Fix the issue
3. Re-run validation
4. Repeat until passing

### 3.7 Update context_session and the github comment of the plan File

After each significant change:
- Mark completed tasks with checkboxes
- Add notes about what was done
- Document any deviations

### 3.8 Update State File Progress Log

Append to Progress Log section using this format:

```markdown
## Iteration {N} - {ISO timestamp}

### Completed
- {Task 1 summary}
- {Task 2 summary}

### Validation Status
- Type-check: PASS/FAIL ({error count if failing})
- Tests: PASS/FAIL ({X/Y passing})
- Build: PASS/FAIL

### Learnings
- {Pattern discovered: "this codebase uses X for Y"}
- {Gotcha found: "don't forget to Z when doing W"}
- {Context: "the component X is in directory Y"}

### Next Steps
- {What still needs to be done}
- {Specific blockers to address}

---
```

### 3.9 Consolidate Codebase Patterns

If you discover a **reusable pattern**, add it to the "Codebase Patterns" section at the TOP of the state file:

```markdown
## Codebase Patterns
- Use `sql<number>` template for type-safe SQL aggregations
- Always use `IF NOT EXISTS` in migrations
- Export types from actions.ts for UI components
```

Only add patterns that are **general and reusable**, not iteration-specific.

**PHASE_3_CHECKPOINT:**
- [ ] Context read (patterns, previous progress)
- [ ] All tasks attempted
- [ ] All validations run
- [ ] Plan file updated
- [ ] Commit comment updated
- [ ] State file progress log updated
- [ ] Patterns consolidated if discovered

---

## Phase 4: COMPLETION CHECK

### 4.1 Verify All Validations Pass

ALL of these must be true:
- [ ] All tasks in plan completed
- [ ] Type check passes
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met

### 4.2 If ALL Pass - Complete the Loop

1. **Generate Implementation Report**

   Create `.claude/reports/{plan-name}-report.md`:

   ```markdown
   # Implementation Report

   **Plan**: {plan_path}
   **Completed**: {timestamp}
   **Iterations**: {N}

   ## Summary
   {What was implemented}

   ## Tasks Completed
   {List from plan}

   ## Validation Results
   | Check | Result |
   |-------|--------|
   | Type check | PASS |
   | Tests | PASS |
   | Build | PASS |

   ## Codebase Patterns Discovered
   {From state file Codebase Patterns section}

   ## Learnings
   {Consolidated from state file progress log}

   ## Deviations from Plan
   {Any changes made}
   ```

2. **Archive the Ralph Run**

   ```bash
   # Create archive directory
   DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
   PLAN_NAME=$(basename {plan_path} .plan.md)
   ARCHIVE_DIR=".claude/ralph-archives/${DATE}-${PLAN_NAME}"
   mkdir -p "$ARCHIVE_DIR"

   # Copy state file (with all learnings)
   cp .claude/ralph.state.md "$ARCHIVE_DIR/state.md"

   # Copy the context_session plan
   cp {plan_path} "$ARCHIVE_DIR/context_session.md"

   # Extract consolidated learnings
   # (The report serves as learnings.md)
   cp .claude/reports/{plan-name}-report.md "$ARCHIVE_DIR/learnings.md"
   ```

3. **Update CLAUDE.md with Permanent Patterns (if applicable)**

   If any patterns from "Codebase Patterns" section are significant enough to be permanent project knowledge:

   - Read the project's CLAUDE.md
   - Add new patterns to appropriate section
   - Avoid duplicating existing patterns

   Example addition:
   ```markdown
   ## Patterns Discovered via Ralph
   - {Pattern that should be permanent}
   ```

4. **Archive Plan to Completed**

   ```bash
   mkdir -p .claude/plans/completed
   mv {plan_path} .claude/plans/completed/
   ```

5. **Clean Up State**

   ```bash
   rm .claude/ralph.state.md
   ```

6. **Output Completion Promise**

   ```
   <promise>COMPLETE</promise>
   ```

### 4.3 If NOT All Pass - End Iteration

If validations are not all passing:
- Document current state in progress log
- End your response normally
- The stop hook will feed the prompt back for next iteration

**Do NOT output the completion promise if validations are failing.**

---

## Handling Edge Cases

### Max Iterations Reached

If iteration count reaches max_iterations:
- Document what's incomplete
- Document what's blocking
- Archive current state (even if incomplete)
- Suggest next steps
- Loop will exit automatically (stop hook handles this)

### Stuck on Same Issue

If you notice you're stuck (same error multiple iterations):
1. Document the blocker clearly in progress log
2. Check "Codebase Patterns" - maybe there's a hint
3. Try alternative approaches
4. If truly stuck, document for human review

### Plan Has Errors

If the plan itself has issues:
- Document the problems in progress log
- Suggest corrections
- Continue with what's executable

---

## Learnings Feedback System

The Ralph loop captures learnings that can improve the system:

### During Loop
- **Codebase Patterns**: Added to state file, read by future iterations
- **Progress Log**: Detailed notes on what worked/failed

### After Completion
- **Archive**: Full state preserved in `.claude/ralph-archives/`
- **Report**: Consolidated learnings in report file
- **CLAUDE.md Updates**: Permanent patterns added to project config
- **Commit**: Commit the changes step by step and create a PR to develop

### Using Archives for Improvement

Archives can be used to:
1. Train better context_session plan generation
2. Identify common failure patterns
3. Improve validation command suggestions
4. Update skill documentation with real examples

```bash
# List all Ralph archives
ls -la .claude/ralph-archives/

# Review learnings from a specific run
cat .claude/ralph-archives/2024-01-12-feature-name/learnings.md
```
